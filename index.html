	    	<div class="article eight columns">
	    		<p> Democrat John Hamilton won the Bloomington mayoral election with 77 percent of the vote. </p>
				<p>“I’m glad we’re continuing a tradition of progressive Democrat mayors,” Hamilton said in his  acceptance speech Tuesday night.</p>
				<p>He thanked his family members and staff, as well as Bloomington’s “working men and women,” for their support.</p>
				<p>“We have a lot of good work ahead,” Hamilton said. “What we want is ... 50 years from now, for people to look back and say that, together, all the people in this room made good decisions.”</p>
				<p> Hamilton and the rest of the Bloomington Democratic candidates and staff gathered and made their speeches in the Players Pub.</p>
				<p>In his campaign, Hamilton emphasized inclusionary zoning, which make portions of new housing construction more affordable, and increasing sustainability  efforts.</p>
				<p>He advocated working with the Bloomington tech park to facilitate new jobs and increasing community policing, especially in the  downtown area.</p>
				<p>An IU Maurer School of Law graduate, Hamilton served as the secretary of the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration, where he oversaw welfare and state aid programs.</p>
				<p>He was also the commissioner of the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and  focused on preserving the state’s natural resources.</p>
				<p>Republican candidate John Turnbull emphasized downtown aesthetics and capitalizing on the construction of Interstate 69 in his campaign.</p>
				<p>Turnbull was the first Republican to file for Bloomington mayor in eight years. He said he intended to balance the Democratic Bloomington council and open up discussions with IU about incoming student demographics.</p>
				<p>Turnbull had a private election party Tuesday night. He did not immediately comment on the election results.</p>
				<p>All of the Democratic candidates for Bloomington’s common council also made their acceptance speeches Tuesday night.</p>
				<p>Nicole Bolden, who was announced as the new City Clerk, said she looks forward to working with the new  mayor.</p>
				<p>“I think we had two very nice men running for mayor, and I think John Hamilton will be an excellent mayor for the city,” she said.</p>
				<p>Bolden said she anticipated Hamilton will increase government transparency and outreach in the community, as he said during his campaign.</p>
				<p>She said she also hoped he would institute citywide broadband and continue “being dedicated to making Bloomington the best it can be for all.”</p>
				<p>Mark Fraley, the Democratic Party chair for Monroe County, said the widespread Democratic victory indicated Bloomington voters liked their leadership.</p>
				<p>“Obviously, we’re thrilled with the results we have gotten today,” Fraley said. “I think the voters of Bloomington have reaffirmed their commitment to Democratic values.”</p>
				<p>Petitions were passed around Players Pub to gain support for future state  election candidates.</p>
				<p>Fraley said the goal was to win support at the local level so potential candidates could compete at the state level.</p>
				<p>“We’re already looking toward 2016,” Fraley said. </p>
